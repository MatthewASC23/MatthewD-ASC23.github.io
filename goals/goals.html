            As of now they're a little vague, but I knew I wanted to 
            do something related to physical science as soon as I was
            introduced to it. I find it facinating and there's lots of potential
            for big discoveries in it as far as I know. Right now I'm considering
            either chemistry or particle physics, the two fields that first sparked
            this love. Learning more about computer science through the SI has piqued my interest 
            in computer science, and has even made me consider pursuing it as a career however.
            Regardless of what I choose to pursue in the future, I intend to make
            sure it's something that I love doing

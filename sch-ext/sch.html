                I'm a high school student of The Scholars' Academy, but the extracurriculars
                are what have made my high school experience interesting. I was a stage manager during my
                sophmore year, while being part of my school's swimming, both of which i enjoyed more than I
                expected. I'm even working towards improving my swimming ability this summer in conjunction
                with the Summer Intensive. There's a very wide range in the activities I take part
                in, but the one thing they all have in common is my enjoyment of them all.

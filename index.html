                I'm a high school student of The Scholars' Academy, but the extracurriculars
                are what have made my high school experience interesting. I was a stage manager during my
                sophmore year, while being part of my school's swimming, both of which i enjoyed more than I
                expected. I'm even working towards improving my swimming ability this summer in conjunction
                with the Summer Intensive. There's a very wide range in the activities I take part
                in, but the one thing they all have in common is my enjoyment of them all.

            As of now they're a little vague, but I knew I wanted to 
            do something related to physical science as soon as I was
            introduced to it. I find it facinating and there's lots of potential
            for big discoveries in it as far as I know. Right now I'm considering
            either chemistry or particle physics, the two fields that first sparked
            this love. Learning more about computer science through the SI has piqued my interest 
            in computer science, and has even made me consider pursuing it as a career however.
            Regardless of what I choose to pursue in the future, I intend to make
            sure it's something that I love doing

            Everything mentioned before can also be considered interests,
            but something that serves as pure lesiure for me is competitive
            Pokemon, specifically doubles. I'm not sure it's for everyone but
            I really enjoy following top players and building teams of my own,
            but it can be pretty overwhelming if your unfamiliar with the basics
            of competitive play. This <a href="https://www.vgcguide.com/" target="_blank">VGC guide</a>
            covers the most fundamental aspects of teambuilding, watching, and playing.
            You can both build teams and play against others online using this
